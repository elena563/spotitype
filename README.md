# SpotiType (work in progress...)

SpotiType is a web application that, given a Spotify playlist or a list of 5 songs, can tell you what kind of listener you are.

The frontend is made with ReactJS, the backend uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) trained on [Kaggle Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset), labelled through a K-Means clustering.


#### Technologies:

Frontend: ReactJS (Vite), libraries: Recharts, Lucide (for icons)
Backend: Python, libraries: Flask, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
